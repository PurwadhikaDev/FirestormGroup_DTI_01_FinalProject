## Background

Effective management of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is crucial for auto insurance companies to maintain a competitive edge and maximize profitability. Research by Frederick Reichheld at Bain & Company shows that improving customer retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%. 

Machine learning techniques are employed to predict CLV by analyzing historical data to identify valuable patterns and trends. This project utilizes such techniques to forecast CLV and guide strategic decisions in the auto insurance sector.

## Problem Statement

1. **Customer Value**: Identifying which customers are the most valuable.
2. **Customer Characteristics**: Understanding what traits define top customers and how to enhance their engagement.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Determining the best way to allocate resources to maximize CLV.

## Machine Learning Goals

The project aims to:
- Predict the CLV for midmarket customers of an auto insurance company.
- Use CLV predictions to aid strategic decision-making and resource allocation.

## Business Goals

The primary business objectives are:
1. **Improved Retention**: Enhance customer retention rates through accurate CLV predictions.
2. **Increased Profitability**: Boost profitability by identifying and retaining high-value customers.

## Key Strategies

1. **Midmarket Focus**: Tailor strategies to understand and meet the needs of midmarket customers based on CLV predictions.
2. **High-Value Focus**: Allocate resources to enhance satisfaction and engagement of high-value customers.

## Actionable Insights

1. **Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis**: Implement RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to prioritize high-value customer segments.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Provide personalized resources and support to high-value customers to boost their experience and lifetime value.
3. **Retention Strategies**: Develop and implement strategies to retain customers with high future earning potential.
