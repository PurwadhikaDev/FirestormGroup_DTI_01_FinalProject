**Background:**

In the auto insurance industry, effective management of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is crucial for sustaining competitive advantage and maximizing profitability. Frederick Reichheld's research at Bain & Company reveals that improving customer retention by just 5% can lead to profit increases ranging from 25% to 95%. This statistic underscores the importance of fostering long-term customer relationships and implementing targeted retention strategies.

Machine learning offers a powerful tool for predicting CLV by analyzing historical data to identify patterns and trends. In this final project, we apply machine learning techniques to forecast CLV in the auto insurance sector.

**Problem Statement:**

1. Which customers are most valuable?
2. What characteristics define top customers, and how can the company enhance their engagement?
3. How can company makes best allocate resources to maximize the CLV of our most promising customers?

**ML Goals:**

The primary goal of this machine learning project is to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for midmarket customers of an auto insurance company. CLV prediction will enable the company to anticipate the future value associated with each customer, aiding in strategic decision-making and resource allocation to hopefully enhance the midmarket customer to give more value to the company in the future.


**Business Goals:**

The overarching business goal is to improve customer retention and increase the retention rate. By accurately predicting CLV, the company aims to identify and retain midmarket and high-value customers more effectively. This approach is expected to lead to higher profitability through increased customer loyalty and reduced churn.


**Key Strategies:**

1. **Focus on Midmarket Customers:** Implement strategies to understand and cater to the needs of midmarket customers, leveraging insights from CLV predictions to tailor personalized experiences and services.
   
2. **Focus on High-Value Customers:** Devote resources towards enhancing the satisfaction and engagement of high-value customers identified through CLV predictions. This involves offering premium services, proactive support, and personalized offers to maximize their long-term value to the company.

**Actionable Insights:**

1. **Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis**: Utilize RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to identify and prioritize high-value customer segments.

2. **Resource Allocation for Key Customers**: Provide high-value and strategically important customers with tailored resources and personalized support. This targeted approach ensures that these customers receive the attention they need to enhance their experience and increase their lifetime value.

3. **Retention Strategies for Future Growth**: Implement strategies to retain and nurture customers identified as having high future earning potential.
